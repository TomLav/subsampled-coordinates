All tie-point related variables, including the tie-point interpolation container variable, are in the group `tie_points`.

The tie-point interpolation container variable is identified by the attribute name `tie_point_interpolation_name`.

All tie-point related variables in the tie-point group have the same variable names and dimension names as required for the expansion in the parent group. That should make the process of expansion easier.

The interpolation container variable is the only one referenced from the `ndvi` variable.
